details: My first ever blog post with a new blogging system.
post_no: 1

As a developer, we use soo any resources online to create new things. I, similarly, have used many tutorials, reviews, blogs from
people who take time off to educate others for no cost. As a courtesy to 'give back to the community', I am starting a new blog
where I write my tech adventures, problems I faced during those adventures and how I solved them.

I hope to publish at least one blog per month. But time will tell my consistency.

Signing off,
Shashank.
